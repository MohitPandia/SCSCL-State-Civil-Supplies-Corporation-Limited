SCSCL is a mini project of the full stack development of the state department (Govt Organization).
SCSCL is the department that manages the farmer registration and purchase of different commodities at minimum support prices from the farmer. It has warehouses in different cities and purchases commodities from farmers.The farmer first can register, and after getting an approval request from the admin, the farmer can come to the
SCSCL warehouse and sell his commodity. The commodity is then transferred to MSP(Minimum Selling Price) shops, and people can purchase it from there.
